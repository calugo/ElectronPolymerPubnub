# Desktop GUI for data plotting and logging data streams from an Arduino. It is build using Electron, Johnny-five and Polymer components. Alo has some IoT experimental functionality using PubNub.

This electron desktop application plots, logs, and streams data via PubNub from an Arduino board, the GUI is built using Polymer (1.x) components. It is always work in progress.

This project is heavily inspired in the great repos of [leoweigand](https://github.com/leoweigand/electron-arduino-quickstart) and [sofroniewn](https://github.com/sofroniewn/electron-johnny-five-examples), the serialport issues with Electron are corrected based in a  [tutorial](http://meow.noopkat.com/using-johnny-five-within-an-electron-app/) by [noopkat.](https://github.com/noopkat)
The layout so far includes a set of buttons and a two plot panels, all the elements in the application are webcomponents: The buttons are paper-button elements and the charts are  [highcharts](https://github.com/avdaredevil/highcharts-chart) components. The highcharts components API can be consulted [here](https://github.com/avdaredevil/highcharts-chart).

The buttons have the following functionality:

1. _**START**_: turns on and off  the data stream from one or two selected Arduino pins.
1. _**RECORD**_: Starts or stops a data stream to files stored in the apps source folder __Logs/__. The logs are stored as __SClog0.dat__, __SClog1.dat__ or __TClog0.dat__,... etc, depending of the number of active channels (one or two). The numeric index represents the event of recording since the application started. This soon will be refined to a date-time format I guess. If you have a log stored and closed and restarted the application be mindful as the indexing resets and any previous log with the same index will be overwritten.
1. _**LOAD**_ : Loads and plot a log file.
1. _**IOT**_: streams the data to a PubNub channel, if you have a set of keys and a page somewhere, you should change these in the source code, otherwise it will be streamed and plotted to my settings!. This functionality is implemented for a single channel at the moment.
1. _**LED**_ Hello world to turn on and off the on-board led.

There are a lot of things I intend to do to imporve this,  if you have and idea or a contribution please share!

The plot panel on the left displays temporal series for the sensor values connected, the left panel plots signal against the other, this only works if two two channel are active.
## OS notes

The app works out of the box in Linux and OSX, I have not tried it out in Windows. I really hope to be able to provide installers at some point.

Below there are installation instructions that I modified from [leoweigand's](https://github.com/leoweigand/electron-arduino-quickstart) README.

## Prerequisites
First, you have to install Firmata on your Arduino, which is a protocol for communicating with microcontrollers. In the Arduino IDE, select the `Firmata Plus` sketch from the examples folder and upload it to your board.
Be sure to have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, as well Electron:
```bash
npm install -g electron
```

## How to use
First, hook up your Arduino with Firmata loaded on to it.
Next, clone this repository and install the dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/calugo/ElectronPolymerPubnub.git
cd ElectronPolymerPubnub
npm install
bower install
```
Use `npm start` to run the app and you are ready to go!

All the markup and js is contained in **src/epoly-app/epoly-app.html**

If you get an error because of missing **xcode-commandline-tools**, install the command-line-tools and execute `npm run postinstall`. After that, you should be able to use npm start as shown before.

## Whatâ€™s next?
I recommend looking into the documentation of both Johnny-Five and Electron for more information on the topic. If something is not working, feel free to [open a new issue](https://github.com/calugo/ElectronPolymerPubnub/issues/new).

## Why is this useful?
If you want to program an Arduino using JavaScript, Johnny-Five and node.js are a great way to start. This basic UI, uses Electron, jQuery and other libraries and directly speak to Arduinos when actions occur in the browser window.

Unfortunately, there are some difficulties to overcome using Electron and the `serialport` library required by Johnny-Five which take time and might be confusing for beginners. As outlined in the tutorial by @noopkat, this repo fixes these problems and provides the boilerplate code for getting started with hardware prototyping in Electron.

# If you succeed installing the app. You should see something like this:
